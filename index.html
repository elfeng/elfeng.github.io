    <h1>1Hey, glad you found Elaine's little space.</h1>

    <h2>This is Elaine...</h2>
    <p>Elaine is a 3rd-year UBC Computer Science coding monkey.</p>
    <p>Elaine loves to hang out at programming contests and tech conferences.</p>
    <p>Elaine did not start programming in high school/elementary school/at 3, but she is serious about making an impact with technology.</p>
    <p>Elaine goes out of her way over abrupt ideas that pump her up (e.g. making a video to send to old friends in home country just so they would miss me).</p>
    <p>Elaine thinks Apple Calendar is awesome.</p>
    <p>Elaine is annoyed with how LinkedIn doesn't support changing the cover picture for projects.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact?: Elaine has been losing a bunch of hair since living in --> V-A-N-C-O-U-V-E-R. This is what she blames for all her bad hair days.</p>
